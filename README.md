# My simulation project

Midterm project using tkinter and simulating computer networks. It's the light version of "Game of life" simulation with my own rules. 
There are pink and blue rectangles that represent girls and boys. This idea is related to tasks in biology on the topic of genetics. 

## Rules of simulation:
- Rule 1: If there are two pink cells in the neighbour's cells, then a girl is born.
- Rule 2: If there are less than two or more than three cells in the neighbour's cells, then no one is born.
- Rule 3: If there are three blue cells in the neighbour's cells, then a boy is born.
